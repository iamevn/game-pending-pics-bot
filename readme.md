Really basic code to upload a random thumbnail from Game Pending's YouTube channel to
[@game-pending-pics](https://cohost.org/game-pending-pics) on cohost.

Needs a [cohost cookie](https://github.com/valknight/Cohost.py#retrieving-your-cookie)
and a [YouTube Data API key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs)
to be set in [`secrets.py`](secrets.py).

You'll probably want to change the `channel_id`, `uploads_playlist`,
and cohost `project` if you use this.
